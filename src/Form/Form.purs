----------
-- Validation

-- We'll start our form with validation.
--
-- We can define small validators that can be composed together to create a sequence
-- of checks that a field will have to pass to be considered valid.
--
-- Validators have the Validation type:
-- newtype Validation m err input output = Validation (input -> m (V err output))
--
-- which can be run with the `runValidation` function:
-- runValidation :: input output err m. Validation m err input output -> (input -> m (V err output))
--
-- runValidation makes it more clear what's going on. You have a function from some input type
-- to the result of validating that type in some monadic context. For example, you might validate
-- an input integer from a number field to ensure it is greater than 10, returning either errors
-- or the validated integer.
--
-- If your validator doesn't run any effectful computations (like reading from a database) you can
-- leave the monad polymorphic.
--
-- To turn a simple true/false checker into a Validation, you can use the `hoist` functions from the
-- Validation module. If you have a pure computation, use hoistFnV; if you have an effectful one,
-- use hoistFnMV.

-- This validator will check that the input string has the "@" symbol as a naive email validation.
-- Its input type is a String, and it outputs a validated String. There are no effectful computations,
-- so we leave the monad polymorphic and use hoistFnV. Finally, we're going to create a new error variant.
--
-- The variant will contain the string that failed, so we can easily inspect the reason for failure.

malformed :: ∀ m err
  . Monad m
  => Validation m (Array (Variant (malformed :: String | err))) String Email
malformed = Validation.hoistFnV \str →
  if contains (Pattern "@") str
    then pure $ Email str
    else Invalid [ inj (SProxy :: SProxy "malformed") str ]

-- This validator mimics checking a database to ensure an email is not already used; it
-- does that using a coin toss. Because of that, we're no longer in any monad; we need
-- to be in a monad supporting Eff and the RANDOM effect type.
--
-- Otherwise, this validator looks similar to the previous one. We define a new error
-- variant, we take a string as input, and we return a validated string.
inUse :: ∀ m eff err
  . MonadEff (random :: RANDOM | eff) m
 => Validation m (Array (Variant (inUse :: String | err))) Email Email
inUse = Validation.hoistFnMV \e@(Email str) -> do
  v <- liftEff random
  pure (pure e)

-- These validators ensure that an input string is within some length. It shows how
-- you can create validators that rely on arguments to determine how they behave. It also
-- demonstrates how variants can carry extra information to help you diagnose errors: in
-- this case, our variant shows the string input and the value it failed to be greater than.
tooShort :: ∀ m err
  . Monad m
 => Int
 -> String
 -> Validation m (Array (Variant (tooShort :: Tuple Int String | err))) String String
tooShort min text = Validation.hoistFnV \str ->
  if length str > min
    then pure str
    else Invalid [ inj (SProxy ∷ SProxy "tooShort") (Tuple min str) ]

tooLong :: ∀ m err
  . Monad m
 => Int
 -> Validation m (Array (Variant (tooLong :: Tuple Int String | err))) String String
tooLong max = Validation.hoistFnV \str →
  if length str < max
    then pure str
    else Invalid [ inj (SProxy :: SProxy "tooLong") (Tuple max str) ]

-- Another simple validator; this one ensures that the input contains a digit.
missingDigit :: ∀ m err
  . Monad m
 => Validation m (Array (Variant (missingDigit :: String | err))) String String
missingDigit = Validation.hoistFnV \str →
  let
    chars = toCharArray str
  in
    if any (_ `elem` chars) (toCharArray "0123456789")
      then pure str
      else Invalid [ inj (SProxy :: SProxy "missingDigit") str ]


----------
-- Composed Validators

-- We can freely compose validators. The resulting validator will contain the variant of all possible
-- errors, though composing with (>>>) will short-circuit at the first failed validation.
emailFieldValidation :: ∀ m eff
  . MonadEff (random :: RANDOM | eff) m
 => Validation m (Array EmailError) String Email
emailFieldValidation = malformed >>> inUse

passwordFieldValidation :: ∀ m
  . Monad m
 => Int
 -> Int
 -> Validation m (Array PasswordError) String String
passwordFieldValidation min max = tooShort min ("Passwords must be at least " <> show min <> " characters long.") >>> tooLong max >>> missingDigit


-- | INPUT
--
-- Your input is the the set of values that you are holding on to in your state
-- so you can run validation on them. You'll generally have a record with all fields
-- in the form. For this form, we'll be working with a few types of DOM inputs, so
-- we'll write a type for them.
--
-- In each case, we want to hold on to the actual value and whether or not we want
-- validation to run on it. Holding this 'validate' flag will let us not validate
-- fields until they've been edited by the user, for example.

type InputValue a = { value :: a, validate :: Boolean }

-- Here's a set of input values in practice.

type FormFieldsT f =
  ( email     :: f String
  , password1 :: f String
  , password2 :: f String
  )

type Id a  = a
type K a b = a

type FormFieldValue    = Variant (FormFieldsT Id)
type FormFieldValidate = Variant (FormFieldsT (K Boolean))
type RawForm           = Record  (FormFieldsT InputValue)


-- Your input state is not the same as your form -- though it will contain the raw
-- values that you want to validate! Your input state is just the contents of what
-- the user has input into the DOM. So where does the form come in?

-- | FIELDS
-- Forms are made up of fields. At minimum, a field on your form will need to carry the list
-- of possible validation errors that can occur in it, and the value that successful validation
-- should result in.
--
-- However, since we're going to use these fields to render our form in the DOM, we're going
-- to want to carry extra information for rendering.
--
-- In our case, we'll define a FieldValue type. It will hold on to a value of type V:
--
-- data V e a = Invalid e | Valid e a
--
-- If the field fails to validate, we'll get an Invalid with an array of errors. If it validates,
-- we'll get a Valid with the form and the successful value.

type FieldValue attrs err a =
  { value         :: V (Array err) a
  , inputValue    :: a -> FormFieldValue
  , inputValidate :: Boolean -> FormFieldValidate
  | attrs }

-- Now, our form will be made up of lots of fields, and these fields can have all sorts of different
-- FieldValue types. We need to be able to pass any kind of field into a form, and so we'll wrap them
-- up in a sum type. Then, our form can be made up of any of these field types.
--
-- Our form has two distinct field types: email and password. We'll newtype emails to demonstrate
-- validation has succeeded, but leave passwords as strings.

newtype Email = Email String
derive instance newtypeEmail :: Newtype Email _

-- While we haven't yet actually written our validation, I'll assume we already know how our fields can
-- fail. An email address can fail because it's malformed or because we checked our database and it's
-- already in use. A password can fail because it's too long, too short, or doesn't have a number in it.

type EmailError = Variant ( malformed :: String, inUse :: String )
type PasswordError = Variant ( missingDigit :: String, tooShort :: Tuple Int String, tooLong :: Tuple Int String )

-- Now, we're ready to create that sum type with our fields. Since we defined FieldValue to allow any
-- extra attributes we want, we can provide them now. We'll give labels to both field types, and we'll
-- make sure passwords get help text.

data Field
  = EmailField    (FieldValue (label :: String) EmailError String)
  | PasswordField (FieldValue (label :: String, helpText :: String) PasswordError String)

-- | FORMS

-- Our form is going to be a simple tuple: an array of strings representing
-- form-level errors and an array of fields in the form.

type Form = Tuple (Array String) (Array Field)

-- Let's build our form without any external helpers
-- This function builds a single-field form from:
--  * record accessor function
--  * field type constructor
--  * field validation
--
-- Here we can also observe that validation is
-- nothing more than function from input to V
-- in monadic context.

  = (lift2 {password1: _, password2: _} <$> (buildPasswordForm _.password1 pass1) <*> (buildPasswordForm _.password2 pass2))
  -- Here we are composing validations, so the previous step results are

  -- We can always fail here and return a form representing our error, which
  -- will be appended to the whole form.
